Hi

This is a full filesplitter.I dedicate it to you.You have permission to use it in any
way you like with my name or your name, distribute it or sell it !
I didn't include these two files wich are necessary for run this app :

comdlg32.ocx
mscomctl.ocx

because these OCXs are in system32 folder of windows of any PC that VB has installed on
it and you will be safe to use your own (OCXs are executable, never use them from
unknown resources)

another file you may need is microsoft visual basic virtual 
machine (if you'll run it on some platforms like windows98)
you can find it in system32 folder of windowsXP and the name
is MSVBVM60.dll or something like this (I don't remember now).


have fun !

Regards Dr. Y
